# Website Performance Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve the website's loading speed from 2 minutes to under 5 seconds.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. CSS Optimization

- **Critical CSS Extraction**: Created a `critical.css` file containing only the essential styles needed for the initial viewport rendering.
- **CSS Loading Strategy**: 
  - Critical CSS is loaded immediately
  - Non-critical CSS is deferred using `media="print"` with an `onload` handler to switch to `media="all"`
  - Fallback provided via `<noscript>` for browsers with JavaScript disabled

### 2. Image Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: 
  - Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all images
  - Implemented enhanced lazy loading with IntersectionObserver via `lazy-load.js`
  - Provided fallbacks for browsers without native lazy loading support

### 3. Resource Preloading and Preconnecting

- **Preconnect**: Added `<link rel="preconnect">` for external domains to establish early connections
- **Resource Prioritization**: Prioritized critical resources and deferred non-critical ones

### 4. JavaScript Optimization

- **Deferred Loading**: Used `defer` attribute for scripts to prevent blocking page rendering
- **Script Loader**: Implemented a custom script loader (`script-loader.js`) to manage loading of non-critical scripts after page load

### 5. HTML Structure Optimization

- **Optimized Resource Loading Order**: Restructured HTML to load critical resources first
- **Reduced Render-Blocking Resources**: Minimized resources that block the initial page render

## Results

These optimizations should significantly reduce the website's loading time from 2 minutes to under 5 seconds by:

1. Reducing the critical rendering path
2. Minimizing render-blocking resources
3. Deferring non-critical assets
4. Prioritizing above-the-fold content
5. Implementing progressive enhancement techniques

## Future Recommendations

1. **Image Compression**: Consider further compressing images or using next-gen formats like WebP
2. **CDN Usage**: Consider using a CDN for serving static assets
3. **Server-Side Caching**: Implement server-side caching mechanisms
4. **HTTP/2**: Ensure the server supports HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections
5. **Minification**: Minify all CSS and JavaScript files to reduce file sizes
